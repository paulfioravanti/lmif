# Java Programming G - Practicals

These files are a grab-bag of Java files from practical/tutorial exercises.

I could not seem to find the specifications of the problems that they solve, so
they just stand as they are, without any external context.

## Compile/Run

```sh
javac *.java
java <TheFileYouWantToRun>
```

## Content Changes

Since the university provided its own module for user input, `cs1.Keyboard`,
which I do not have the source code for, I made some code changes to
use `java.util.Scanner` for user input.
