# Java Programming G - Assignment 4 Question 2

## Summarised Original Specifications

Write a Java class called MyVector that has the main features of a Java Vector
class. The data should be stored internally in a linked list. You must create
your own linked list class to use in MyVector. You must not use the Java API's
LinkedList class.

Write a program called TestMyVect that stores 10 objects of various types in a
MyVector object then retrieves and displays them.

## Compile/Run

Note: `TestMyVect.java uses or overrides a deprecated API`, so it needs the
`-Xlint` compilation flag.

```sh
javac -Xlint *.java
java TestMyVect
```
