# Component Engineering

Component Engineering was a subject where I learned about "the concepts and
practice of building software applications from components".

Unfortunately, I was unable to to post my first assignment, an implementation
of [Conway's Game of Life][], as it used [JavaBeans][] with BeanBuilder, which
at this point seems like it's become [Abandonware][], and I could not find any
other way to make it run.

My third assignment was a paper comparing JavaBeans and [.NET][] as component
technologies for developing applications to run on a desktop computer. Since
there was no code involved, so I have excluded it from this repository.
