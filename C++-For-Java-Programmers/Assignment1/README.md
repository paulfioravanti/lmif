# C++ for Java Programmers - Assignment 1

## Summarised Original Specifications

You are required to write a program that simulates the operation of a car.
More specifically, the program should simulate the dynamics of the drive train
of a car. You are required to design classes that will simulate each of the
major components of the drive train. These components are the engine, gearbox,
diff, and wheels.

## Compile/Run

```sh
make clean
make
./A1Main
```

## Changes

I needed to make a small change to `A1Main.cpp` and comment out line 222:
`cin.clear(1000)` in order to actually make the program work again.

I restrained myself from getting rid of the `^M` DOS line endings.
